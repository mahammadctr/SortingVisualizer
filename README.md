# Sorting Visualizer

A web application that visualizes the inner workings of various sorting algorithms. This project is designed to help users understand how different sorting algorithms operate and perform under different conditions.

## Implemented Algorithms

- **Bubble Sort**
- **Selection Sort**
- **Insertion Sort**
- **Merge Sort**
- **Quick Sort**
- **Heap Sort**

## Features

### Colored Representation of Sorting Steps

Each step of the sorting process is color-coded to enhance visual understanding:

- **Blue**: Default state
- **Yellow**: Elements currently being compared
- **Red**: Elements identified as being in the wrong position
- **Green**: Elements correctly placed in the sorted section

### Controls for Visualization

- **Speed Control**: Adjust the speed of the visualization with 5 different speed levels.
- **Data Size Control**: Customize the size of the data set being sorted.
- **Generate New Data**: Randomly generate a new data set for sorting.

### Time and Space Complexity

The time and space complexities of the currently visualized algorithm are displayed in real-time, providing an educational insight into algorithm efficiency.

## Live Demo

Check out the live version of the Sorting Visualizer: [Sorting Visualizer Live](https://mahammadctr.github.io/SortingVisualizer/)

## Responsive Design

The website is fully responsive and optimized for devices of all sizes, ensuring a seamless user experience whether on a desktop, tablet, or mobile device.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Structuring the web application
- **CSS3**: Styling the application with a focus on responsiveness and aesthetics
- **JavaScript**: Implementing sorting algorithms and controlling the visualization

## How to Use

1. **Select Algorithm**: Choose the sorting algorithm you wish to visualize from the provided buttons.
2. **Adjust Settings**: Use the range inputs to control the size of the array and the speed of the visualization.
3. **Generate New Array**: Click the "Generate New Array!" button to create a new random data set for sorting.
4. **Start Visualization**: Click on the algorithm button to start the visualization.

## Files and Directories

- **index.html**: The main HTML file that structures the application.
- **css/**: Contains the style.css file for styling the web application.
- **scripts/**: Contains JavaScript files implementing various sorting algorithms and the logic for visualizing them.
